# Vue 2 Composition API TSX Tailwind Starter üêç

Single File Components (`.vue` files) have limited support for type checking - it is not possible to break builds if types are violated within your component template.

Defining components within TSX does not have such a limitation. This repository provides a starting point for fully type safe Vue projects, with Composition API and Tailwind CSS included as a bonus.
